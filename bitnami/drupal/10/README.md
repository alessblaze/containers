# Only latest stable or LTS branch maintained in the free Bitnami catalog

Starting December 10th 2024, only the latest stable or LTS branch of any container will receive updates in the free Bitnami catalog. To access up-to-date releases for all upstream-supported branches, consider upgrading to Bitnami Premium. Previous versions already released will not be deleted. They are still available to pull from DockerHub.

Please check the Bitnami Premium page in our partner [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/na/vendors/bitnami?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=containers) for more information.

# this is a modified version on apache license. not official bitnami container.

We oblige to same bitnami apache 2.0 license and commercial use is prohibited by this directive,
as we did not do all work on it and it is available under only testing/staging/personal usage scenario.
AMS may regularly update the file but will probably not publish a version on any registry. as you have
to build it yourself.

 The build instructions are same and all rest of usage of container is same as official bitnami container.
 Tho no gurantees that all features will work, as it is build only for our purpose.
 No warranty or support provided for it. If you want enteprise grade container do kindly use latest version 
 from bitnami docker hub for free or pay for it as premium.
 
 We reuse certain packages from official bitnami drupal 11 dockerfile which is permissible under apache 2.0.
